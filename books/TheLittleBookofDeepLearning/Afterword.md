# Afterword

Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence have been incredibly exciting, and it is difficult to comment on them without being overly dramatic. There are few doubts that these technologies will cause fundamental changes in how we work, how we interact with knowledge and information, and that they will force us to rethink concepts as fundamental as intelligence, understanding, and sentience.

In spite of its weaknesses, particularly its sheer brutality and its computational cost, deep learning is likely to remain an important component of AI systems for the foreseeable future and, as such, a key element of this new era.
