# Chapter 2 Efficient computation

From an implementation standpoint, deep learning is about executing heavy computations with large amounts of data. The **Graphical Processing Units** (**GPUs**) have been instrumental in the success
of the field by allowing such computations to be run on affordable hardware.

The importance of their use, and the resulting technical constraints on the computations that can be done efficiently, force the research in the field to constantly balance mathematical soundness and implementability of novel methods.
